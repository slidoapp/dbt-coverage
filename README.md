# dbt-coverage

A CLI library with Python backend for computing docs and test coverage of dbt
managed data warehouses.

## Installation

```
pip install dbt-coverage
```

## Usage

`dbt-coverage` comes with two basic commands: `compute` and `compare`. The
documentation for the individual commands can be shown by using the `--help`
option.

### Compute

Compute coverage from `target/catalog.json` and `target/manifest.json` files
found in a dbt project, e.g.
[jaffle_shop](https://github.com/dbt-labs/jaffle_shop). You need to select
documentation or test coverage by using the respective CLI argument.

```
$ cd jaffle_shop
$ dbt run  # Materialize models
$ dbt docs generate  # Generate catalog.json and manifest.json
$ dbt-coverage compute doc --cov-report coverage-doc.json  # Compute doc coverage, print it and write it to coverage-doc.json file

```

### Compare

Compare two `coverage.json` files generated by the `compute` command. This is
useful to ensure that the coverage does not drop while making changes to the
project.

```
$ dbt-coverage compare coverage-after.json coverage-before.json

# Coverage delta summary
              before     after            +/-

- customers           6/7    (85.71%)  ->     6/8    (75.00%) 
-- new_col            -/-       (-)    ->     0/1     (0.00%) 
==============================================================
```

### Combined use-case

```
$ cd my-dbt-project

$ dbt run  # Materialize models
$ dbt docs generate  # Generate catalog.json and manifest.json
$ dbt-coverage compute doc --cov-report before.json --cov-fail-under 0.5  # Fail if coverage is lower than 50%

# Make changes to the dbt project, e.g. add some columns to the DWH, document some columns, etc.

$ dbt run  # Materialize the changed models
$ dbt docs generate  # Generate catalog.json and manifest.json
$ dbt-coverage compute doc --cov-report after.json --cov-fail-compare before.json  # Fail if the current coverage is lower than coverage in before.json
$ dbt-coverage compare after.json before.json  # Generate a detailed coverage delta report
```
